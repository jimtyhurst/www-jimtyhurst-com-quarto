<P>
  Application servers may provide several modes for beginning transactions,
  including:
</P>
<DL>
  <DT><P>
    Manual transaction mode
  <DD>
    You explicitly control when your session begins a transaction. When you
    commit or abort a transaction, you will again be outside of a transaction.
    Changes to existing objects or new objects created while outside of a
    transaction will not be persistent.
  </DD>
  </P></DT>
  <DT><P>
    Automatic transaction mode
  <DD>
    When the client establishes a session with the application server, it is
    immediately put into a transaction and a new transaction is started
    automatically after each commit or abort action.
