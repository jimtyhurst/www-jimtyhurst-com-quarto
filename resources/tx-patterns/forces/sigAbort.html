<P>
  When the client is working outside of a transaction while maintaining
  a session on an application server, the server may
  signal the client to abort (i.e. refresh its view of the repository).
  In response, the client should abort, in order to refresh the current
  view. This allows the application server to reclaim obsolete objects.
