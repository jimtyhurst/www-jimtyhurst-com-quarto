<P>
The views displayed to a particular user must be updated as the domain
model changes on the server (see patterns 
<A href="../view/push.html">Push Model Changes</A>
and 
<A href="../view/pull.html">Pull Model Changes</A>). 
However, these changes may only be integrated into the user's view
at transaction boundaries.
