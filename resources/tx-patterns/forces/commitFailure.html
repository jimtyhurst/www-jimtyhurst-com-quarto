<H3>Failure to commit</H3>
<P>
  When trying to commit a transaction, the commit operation may fail due
  to conflicts with transactions from other clients. In some application
  servers, a transaction that has failed will never succeed in the future.
  Therefore, the client must abort (or <EM>roll back</EM>) the failed transaction
  and start a new transaction with the desired changes. Either the
  application must provide the ability to replay the changes automatically
  or the user will have to re-enter the data manually.
