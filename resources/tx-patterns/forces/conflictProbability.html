<H3>Probability of a commit failure</H3>
<P>
  Your motivation to design and implement a solution for a
  <A href="./commitFailure.html">failure to commit</A>
  depends on the probability of a failure occurring in your particular
  application. If the likelihood of a
  <A href="./writeConflict.html">write-write conflict</A>
  is very very small, then it may be acceptable to simply display an error
  message to the user, abort the transaction, and force the user to
  begin the business transaction again.
  On the other hand, when losing the user's changes is an unacceptable
  solution, especially when it may occur relatively frequently, you
  will want to provide a solution to recover from a
  <A href="./commitFailure.html">failure to commit</A>.
