<P>
  There are several problems associated with long transactions:
<UL>
  <LI><P>
    If locks are held, resources are tied up for the length of the transaction,
    which limits the ability of multiple users to access the data.
  </P></LI>
  <LI><P>
    If locks are not used, the risk of a
    <A href="./commitFailure.html">commit failure</A>
    increases with the length of the transaction, because there is
    a greater time period in which other users might commit a transaction
    that would cause a
    <A href="./writeConflict.html">conflict</A>.
  </P></LI>
  <LI><P>
    The architectures of most application servers encourage short transactions,
    because performance problems can occur when there is a large backlog
    open transactions competing for resources.
