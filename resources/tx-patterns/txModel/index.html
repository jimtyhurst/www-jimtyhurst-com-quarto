    </td>
    <td>
      How can a client application organize a set of domain model changes to be
      submitted in a transaction that is easy to implement?
    </td>
    <td>
      Group all of the changes in a single transaction that has no internal structure.
    </td>

      How can a client application organize a set of domain model changes
      to be submitted in a series of transactions while holding locks across
      transaction boundaries?
    </td>
    <td>
      Commit the work of a
      Flat Transaction
      and then remain in a transaction, while holding previous locks.
    </td>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <a href="./conversational.html">Conversational Transaction</a>
    </td>
    <td>
      How can a client application organize a set of domain model changes
      to be submitted in a transaction where the user needs a relatively
      long time to specify the changes, but the server prefers short
      transactions?
    </td>
    <td>
      Perform one transaction to read data, process the data offline,
      and then submit the changes in a new transaction.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Queued Transaction
    </td>
    <td>
      How can a client application organize a set of domain model changes
      to be submitted in a transaction where there are many clients
      adding new independent data?
    </td>
    <td>
      Specify the actions to be performed in a transaction and submit
      that specification into the queue of a transaction processor.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Nested Transaction
    </td>
    <td>
      How can a client application organize a set of domain model changes
      to be submitted in a transaction where the changes are organized
      in hierarchical increments?
    </td>
    <td>
      Provide a nested structure of transactions, so that each
      embedded transaction can be rolled back without affecting higher
      level transactions.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Distributed Transaction
    </td>
    <td>
      How can a client application organize a set of domain model changes
      to be submitted in a transaction where the domain model
      is distributed across more than one server?
    </td>
    <td>
      Provide a two-phase commit process, where each server verifies
      that it can commit its portion of the transaction before any
      server performs its portion of the commit.
