<h3>Conversational Transaction</h3>
<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>
  How can a client application organize a set of domain model changes
  to be submitted in a transaction where the user needs a relatively
  long time to specify the changes, but the server prefers short
  transactions?
</p>
<h4>Context</h4>
<p>
  You are developing a user interface for a multi-user application that
  commits transactions on an application server. People using the system
  perform business transactions that typically take a few minutes,
  but which may remain open for an arbitrarily long time (e.g. the user
  opens a customer screen and then goes to lunch before saving the data
  that has been entered).
</p>
<h4>Forces</h4>
<ul>
  <li><p>
    <a href="../forces/length.html">Length of transaction</a>.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <a href="../forces/noModOutsideTx.html">Objects cannot be modified outside
      of a transaction</a>.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <a href="../forces/sigAbort.html">Signal to abort</a>.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <a href="../forces/txMode.html">Transaction modes supported by the application server</a>.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
    <a href="../forces/commitFailure.html">Failure to commit</a>.
  </p></li>
</ul>
<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>
  Let the user perform the business transaction outside of a server transaction.
  At the completion of the business transaction, open a server transaction,
  apply the accumulated changes, and commit the transaction.
  The client performs the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Begin a transaction, read some data, and abort the transaction.</li>
  <li>Process the data outside of a transaction.</li>
  <li>Begin a transaction, apply the updates, and commit the transaction.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Resulting Context</h4>
<p>
  In order to apply this pattern, one must have a way of saving changes that
  are made outside of a transaction, so that they can be reapplied inside of
  a transaction. The
  <a href="../client/replay.html">Replay Changes</a>
  pattern provides a solution to this problem.
</p>
<p>
  For long business transactions where objects must be locked for an extended period
  of time, the
  <a href="../client/checkOut.html">Check Out Objects</a>
  pattern provides a way to lock objects while minimizing the use of server
  resources.
</p>
<h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>
  One of the advantages of this solution is that it provides a way to handle long
  business transactions with a server that prefers short transactions.
  By using short server transactions, the application reduces the resource
  requirements placed on the server, resulting in better performance.
