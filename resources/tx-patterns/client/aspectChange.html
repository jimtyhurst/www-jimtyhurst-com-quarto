<H3>Aspect Change Specification</H3>
<H4>Problem</H4>
<P>
  How can a client application record a change to a domain model object
  independently from that object?
</P>
<H4>Context</H4>
<P>
  You are developing a client application and you want to record changes
  to server objects in a
  <A href="./txSpec.html">transaction specification</A>,
  so that the changes can be preserved across transaction boundaries.
  For example, you might want to
  <A href="./replay.html">replay changes</A>
  after aborting a transaction.

      of a transaction</a>.

<H4>Solution</H4>
<P>
  Specify the message that must be sent in order to accomplish the
  desired change. A message is completely specified by its receiver,
  method signature, and arguments.
</P>
<H4>Resulting Context</H4>
<P>
  As a result of adopting this solution, the client application is able to
  <A href="./replay.html">replay changes</A>
  across transaction boundaries. Therefore after an abort, the messages can be
  sent again, in order to redo the desired changes. This solution also supports a
  <A href="../txModel/conversational.html">conversational</A>
  transaction model in which the change specification is built outside of a
  transaction and then replayed inside of a transaction to cause the changes
  to be persistent.
</P>
<H4>Rationale</H4>
<P>
  Flexibility is achieved by maintaining an independent specification of
  changes from the results of the changes themselves. By providing a specification,
  rather than just recording the results, it is possible to reuse the
  specification across transaction boundaries, so that the end user is not
  required to reenter data.

  <LI><P>
    <A href="./dirtyPool.html">Dirty Object Pool</A>
    is an alternative to this <EM>Aspect Change Specification</EM> solution.
    It is another way to record changes to domain objects, so that changes can
    be copied into a new transaction.
