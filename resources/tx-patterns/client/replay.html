<H3>Replay Changes</H3>
<H4>Problem</H4>
<P>
  How can a client application preserve a user's changes after aborting
  a transaction?
</P>
<H4>Context</H4>
<P>
  You are developing a multi-user application that commits
  transactions on an application server. There are several reasons why you might
  want to be able to replay a user's business transaction after aborting
  a server transaction:
</P>
<UL>
  <LI><P>
    If a transaction fails, you need to abort the transaction to get a clean view
    of the repository. However, rather than losing the user's changes, you would
    like to be able to attempt the transaction again.
  </P></LI>
  <LI><P>
    For long business transactions, it may be desirable to change persistent
    objects while outside of a server transaction. However, changes to persistent
    objects can only be saved in the repository while in a transaction.
    Therefore, you might want to allow the user to modify an object outside
    of a transaction, then replay the changes inside of a transaction.

</UL>
<H4>Solution</H4>
<P>
  The client keeps the changes independent from the view of the repository,
  so that when a view is refreshed, the changes may be replayed.
</P>
<H4>Resulting Context</H4>
<P>
  In order to be able to replay changes, you need to be able to identify
  the changes that were made as part of the current business transaction,
  as explained in the
  <A href="./txSpec.html">Transaction Specification</A>
  pattern.
</P>
<P>
  Two different strategies for replaying changes are described in:

  </P></LI>
  <LI><P>
    <A href="../conflict/mergeUpdates.html">Merge Conflicting Updates</A>
  </P></LI>
</UL>
<H4>Rationale</H4>
<P>
  There are two benefits to this solution:
</P>
<OL>
  <LI><P>
    Changes to persistent objects can be made outside of a server transaction,
    which allows you to implement long business transactions with short
    server transactions.
  </P></LI>
  <LI><P>
    You do not lose a user's changes when a commit failure occurs.
  </P></LI>
</OL>
<H4>Related Patterns</H4>
<UL>
  <LI><P>
    <A href="./txSpec.html">Transaction Specification</A>
    provides a record of changes, so that they can be replayed.
  </P></LI>
  <LI><P>
    <A href="./aspectChange.html">Aspect Change Specification</A>
    is a way to record user-initiated changes to domain objects which must
    be replayed.
  </P></LI>
  <LI><P>
    <A href="./dirtyPool.html">Dirty Object Pool</A>
    is another way to record changes to domain objects, so that the changes
    can be copied into a new transaction.
