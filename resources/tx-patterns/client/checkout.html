<H3>Check Out Objects</H3>
<H4>Problem</H4>
<P>
  How can you maintain a lock on an object for a long period of time?
</P>
<H4>Context</H4>
<P>
  You are developing a multi-user application that commits
  transactions on an application server. In your application, there is a
  substantial risk of a commit failure due to the probability of two clients
  modifying the same object during overlapping time intervals and you need to
  lock objects for an extended period of time.

<H4>Solution</H4>
<P>
  Develop a lock table that holds persistent locks for objects that
  have been checked out. The application checks out a copy of the
  object, makes changes, and then checks in the changed copy.
</P>
<H4>Resulting Context</H4>
<P>
  Since the application is making changes outside of a transaction, it will
  need to
  <A href="./replay.html">replay the changes</A>
  within a server transaction. Also, the application must implement the lock table,
  which has its own concurrency issues.
</P>
<H4>Rationale</H4>
<P>
  Application servers typically provide a locking mechanism within transactions.
  However, if updates need to be made during a long period of time,
  it is unreasonable to keep a transaction open
  while the changes are made. For example, if changes are made by an end user
  through a user interface, it is advisable for the changes to be specified
  outside of a transaction. In this case, the application must implement
  its own locking mechanism that will work across transactions.
