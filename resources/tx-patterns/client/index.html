      How can a client application preserve a user's changes after aborting
      a transaction?
    </td>
    <td>
      The client keeps the changes independent from the view of the repository,
      so that when a view is refreshed, the changes may be replayed.

      How can changes to domain model objects be saved independently from
      the domain model?

      Save the sequence of messages that can be sent to cause the desired
      changes to occur.

      How can a client application record a change to a domain model object
      independently from that object?
    </td>
    <td>
      Specify the message that must be sent in order to accomplish the
      desired change. A message is completely specified by its receiver,
      method signature, and arguments.

      How can a client application record a change to a domain model object
      independently from that object?

      How can you maintain a lock on an object for a long period of time?
    </td>
    <td>
      Develop a lock table that holds persistent locks for objects that
      have been checked out. The application checks out a copy of the
      object, makes changes, and then checks in the changed copy.
