<H3>Transaction Specification</H3>
<H4>Problem</H4>
<P>
  How can changes to domain model objects be saved independently from
  the domain model?
</P>
<H4>Context</H4>
<P>
  You are developing a multi-user application that commits
  transactions on an application server. There are several reasons why you might
  want to be able to replay a user's business transaction after aborting
  a server transaction:
</P>
<UL>
  <LI><P>
    If a transaction fails, you need to abort the transaction to get a clean view
    of the repository. However, rather than losing the user's changes, you would
    like to be able to attempt the transaction again.
  </P></LI>
  <LI><P>
    For long business transactions, it may be desirable to change persistent
    objects while outside of a server transaction. However, changes to persistent
    objects can only be saved in the repository while in a transaction.
    Therefore, you might want to allow the user to modify an object outside
    of a transaction, then replay the changes inside of a transaction.

  <H4>Solution</H4>
  <P>
    Save the sequence of messages that can be sent to cause the desired
    changes to occur.
  </P>
  <P>
    A transaction specification represents a sequence of changes to server
    objects. These change specifications are maintained independent of the
    target objects, so that the changes can be preserved after the
    application server aborts a transaction, rolling back the view
    of the repository to a previous state. The changes can then be
    replayed in a new transaction.
  </P>
  <H4>Resulting Context</H4>
  <P>
    As a result of adopting this solution, the developer must decide how to keep
    a record of changes in a business transaction.
    <A href="./aspectChange.html">Aspect Change Specification</A>
    records the sequence of messages that must be sent in order to cause the
    desired changes. After an abort, the messages can be sent again,
    in order to redo the desired changes.
  </P>
  <H4>Rationale</H4>
  <P>
    This solution is relatively easy to implement, although it requires explicit
    code in the client application to record the messages sent to domain objects.
  </P>
  <P>
    The solution does not involve any copying. Therefore, it does not introduce
    a large number of extra temporary objects into the environment. It also
    means that references between objects are maintained with no extra effort.
  </P>
  <P>
    By recording the sequence of messages, business rules that are triggered
    by setter methods will reapply in the correct sequence whenever the
    transaction is replayed.
  </P>

      <A href="./aspectChange.html">Aspect Change Specification</A>
      is a way to record user-initiated changes to domain objects which
      may be replayed.

      <A href="./dirtyPool.html">Dirty Object Pool</A>
      is an alternative to this <EM>Transaction Specification</EM> solution.
      It is another way to record changes to domain objects, so that changes can
      be copied into a new transaction.
