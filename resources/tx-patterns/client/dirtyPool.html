<H3>Dirty Object Pool</H3>
<H4>Problem</H4>
<P>
  How can a client application record a change to a domain model object
  independently from that object?
</P>
<H4>Context</H4>
<P>
  You are developing a client application and you want to record changes
  to server objects in a
  <A href="./txSpec.html">transaction specification</A>,
  so that the changes can be preserved across transaction boundaries.
  For example, you might want to
  <A href="./replay.html">replay changes</A>
  after aborting a transaction.

<H4>Solution</H4>
<P>
  Keep a copy of the object in its changed state, where the copy is local to
  the client and is unaffected by transaction boundaries in the application
  server.
</P>
<H4>Resulting Context</H4>
<P>
  As a result of adopting this solution, the client application is able to
  <A href="./replay.html">replay changes</A>
  across transaction boundaries. Therefore after an abort, data from the non-persistent
  copies of domain objects can be copied into persistent domain objects
  within a transaction,
  in order to redo the desired changes. This solution also supports a
  <A href="../txModel/conversational.html">conversational</A>
  transaction model in which the change specification is built outside of a
  transaction and then replayed inside of a transaction to cause the changes
  to be persistent.
</P>
<H4>Rationale</H4>
<P>
  There are several advantages to this solution:
</P>
<OL>
  <LI><P>
    Changes to persistent objects can be made outside of a server transaction,
    which allows you to implement long business transactions with short
    server transactions.
  </P></LI>
  <LI><P>
    You do not lose a user's changes when a commit failure occurs.
  </P></LI>
</OL>
<P>
  Compared to the
  <A href="./aspectChange.html">Aspect Change Specification</A>
  pattern, this solution requires quite a bit of overhead, because copies
  of the persistent object graph must be maintained in non-persistent
  objects outside of the view of the repository. It is easy to maintain
  a copy of a single object, but for an entire graph, the references between
  objects must also be maintained.

    <A href="./aspectChange.html">Aspect Change Specification</A>
    is an alternative to this <EM>Dirty Object Pool</EM> solution.
    It is another way to record a specification of changes to domain objects,
    so that changes can be replayed in a new transaction.
