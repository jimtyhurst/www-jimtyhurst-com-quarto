<H3>Push Domain Model Changes</H3>
<H4>Problem</H4>
<P>
  When one user commits a transaction that updates the domain model
  on the server, how can a client application display these changes
  to a different user?
</P>
<H4>Context</H4>
<P>
  You are developing a multi-user application that
  commits transactions on an application server. Changes to persistent
  data should be propagated to everyone viewing the data.

<H4>Solution</H4>
<P>
  The client registers as an observer of specific model components
  and the server notifies observers when changes occur.
</P>
<H4>Resulting Context</H4>
<P>
  Changes from other transactions can only be introduced at transaction
  boundaries, so the client developer needs to consider when it is appropriate
  to refresh its view based on the
  <A href="../txModel/index.html">transaction model</A>
  that has been chosen.
</P>
<P>
  Updating a view could overwrite changes that are in progress by the
  end user. Therefore, it may be necessary to
  <A href="../client/index.html">represent the user's changes</A>
  independently of the view.
</P>
<H4>Rationale</H4>
<P>
  Registering as an observer makes it easy for the client to identify
  when its view needs to be updated, because it receives a notification
  everytime this is necessary. In contrast to
  <A href="./pull.html">pulling domain model changes</A>,
  there is no wasted processing time when no view updates are necessary.
</P>
<P>
  If the application server allows for fine granularity of observing
  components, the observer only needs to update its view when
  the specific components of interest are updated. A potential disadvantage
  is that the client must register its interest in a number of components.
</P>
<P>
  A disadvantage is that the client may waste time processing notifications
  when it is not willing to update its view. If notifications are expensive,
  e.g. when a server has many registered observers, the server may experience
  unnecessary delays by notifying observers who do not act on the notification.
