<H3>Last Commit Wins</H3>
<H4>Problem</H4>
<P>
  How can you serialize a set of changes from overlapping business
  transactions that affect the same object?
</P>
<H4>Context</H4>
<P>
  You are developing a multi-user application that
  commits transactions on an application server.
  Two or more transactions may overlap while trying to update the same
  object.

<H4>Solution</H4>
<P>
  A transactional application server allows the first server transaction
  to "win" in the sense that successive transactions having a
  <A href="../forces/writeConflict.html">write-write conflict</A>
  will fail.
  However, it is possible for the second client to abort the failed transaction,
  begin a new transaction,
  <A href="../client/replay.html">replay the changes</A>,
  and commit the new transaction.
</P>
<H4>Resulting Context</H4>
<P>
  In order to provide the ability to replay changes, there must
  be a way to define
  <A href="../client/index.html">transaction specifications</A>
  in the client.
</P>
<H4>Rationale</H4>
<P>
  This is an easy pattern to implement, as long as there is a way to define
  <A href="../client/index.html">transaction specifications</A>
  in the client. At first glance, this solution appears to violate the
  objectives of a transactional system, since the second transaction may
  overwrite the effects of the first transaction. However, as long as
  appropriate business rules validate changes as they are played back,
  there is no risk of changing the repository into an inconsistent state.
</P>
<P>
  One of the disadvantages of this solution is that the software automatically
  resolves the conflict without notifying the end user that a conflict occurred.
  In situations where such notification is important or manual merging of
  changes is more appropriate, then the
  <A href="./firstWins.html">First Commit Wins</A>
  or the
  <A href="./mergeUpdates.html">Merge Conflicting Updates</A>
  patterns are more appropriate.
</P>
<P>
  The disadvantages of this solution may be acceptable when the
  <A href="../forces/conflictProbability.html">probability of a commit failure</A>
  is so low that it can be ignored or where commit failures typically do not
  have business consequences. For example, suppose a customer service organization
  changes addresses and other customer contact information, while a billing
  organization updates a customer's purchasing information. It is possible that
  the application server may report a conflict between a customer service
  transaction and a billing transaction, while from a business perspective the two
  transactions are updating different aspects of the customer object.

<UL>
  <LI><P>
    <A href="./firstWins.html">First Commit Wins</A>
    provides a different solution to this problem by forcing the user
    to start a new business transaction, starting from the updated object
    that results from the first committed transaction.
  </P></LI>
  <LI><P>
    <A href="./mergeUpdates.html">Merge Conflicting Updates</A>
    provides a different solution to this problem by allowing the replay
    of changes in the last transaction to selectively update the conflicting object.
