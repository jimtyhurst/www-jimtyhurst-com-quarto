<H3>Merge Conflicting Updates</H3> 
<H4>Problem</H4>
<P>
How can you serialize a set of changes from overlapping business
transactions that affect the same object when your primary concern
is that users should not have to reenter any data?
</P>
<H4>Context</H4>
<P>
You are developing a multi-user application that
commits transactions on an application server.
Two or more transactions may overlap while trying to update the same
object.

<H4>Solution</H4>
<P>
A transactional application server allows the first server transaction
to "win" in the sense that successive transactions having a
<A href="../forces/writeConflict.html">write-write conflict</A> 
will fail.
However, it is possible for the second client to abort the failed transaction,
begin a new transaction, 
<A href="../client/replay.html">replay the changes</A>,
and commit the new transaction.  While replaying the changes, you must
check each individual change to determine whether there is a conflict
with the first committed transaction.  If so, prompt the user to determine
whether or not the new change should be applied.
</P>
<H4>Resulting Context</H4>
<P>
Changes from other transactions can only be introduced at transaction
boundaries, so the amount of work affected by updating a view will depend
on the 
<A href="../txModel/index.html">transaction model</A>
that has been chosen.
</P>
<P>
In order to provide the ability to replay changes, there must 
be a way to define 
<A href="../client/index.html">transaction specifications</A> 
in the client.
</P>
<H4>Rationale</H4>
<P>
This solution identifies the server transaction conflict to the user,
enabling the user to make the necessary adjustments to merge the two sets
of changes appropriately.  It minimizes the amount of rework that the
end user must do, in order to complete their business transaction.

<UL>
<LI><P>
<A href="./firstWins.html">First Commit Wins</A> 
provides a different solution to this problem by forcing the user
to start a new business transaction, starting from the updated object
that results from the first committed transaction.
</P></LI>
<LI><P>
<A href="./lastWins.html">Last Commit Wins</A> 
provides a different solution to this problem by initiating a new server
transaction automatically and replaying the user's changes, which
may overwrite some of the changes from the first committed transaction.
