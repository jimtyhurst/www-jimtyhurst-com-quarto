<H3>First Commit Wins</H3>
<H4>Problem</H4>
<P>
  How can you serialize a set of changes from overlapping business
  transactions that affect the same object when your primary concern
  is for users to see changes immediately as they occur?
</P>
<H4>Context</H4>
<P>
  You are developing a multi-user application that
  commits transactions on an application server.
  Two or more transactions may overlap while trying to update the same
  object. It is essential that users are aware of each other's
  changes to busines objects.

<H4>Solution</H4>
<P>
  A transactional application server allows the first server transaction
  to "win" in the sense that successive transactions having a
  <A href="../forces/writeConflict.html">write-write conflict</A>
  will fail. Whenever a client application experiences a commit failure,
  abort the transaction, and refresh the user's view from the current state
  of the server. This will cause the user to lose all of their changes,
  forcing them to start a new business transaction.
  They will need to reevaluate the new data manually in order to decide whether
  to redo their changes or not.
</P>
<H4>Resulting Context</H4>
<P>
  Changes from other transactions can only be introduced at transaction
  boundaries, so the amount of work affected by updating a view will depend
  on the
  <A href="../txModel/index.html">transaction model</A>
  that has been chosen.
</P>
<P>
  Since there is no attempt to preserve the user's changes that cause the
  conflict, it is not necessary to
  <A href="../client/index.html">represent the user's changes</A>
  independently of the view.
</P>
<H4>Rationale</H4>
<P>
  This is a very easy pattern to implement. While it sounds terrible to cause the
  end user to redo their work, this may be acceptable when the
  <A href="../forces/conflictProbability.html">probability of a commit failure</A>
  is so low that it can be ignored.
</P>
<H4>Related Patterns</H4>
<UL>
  <LI><P>
    <A href="./mergeUpdates.html">Merge Conflicting Updates</A>
    provides a different solution to this problem by allowing the replay
    of changes in the last transaction to selectively update the conflicting object.
  </P></LI>
  <LI><P>
    <A href="./lastWins.html">Last Commit Wins</A>
    provides a different solution to this problem by initiating a new server
    transaction automatically and replaying the user's changes, which
    may overwrite some of the changes from the first committed transaction.
