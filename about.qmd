I am an experienced machine learning engineer with a Ph.D. in Linguistics, working in:

- machine learning
- natural language processing.
- data engineering
- feature engineering
- statistical analysis
- software engineering
- enterprise application architecture

My past enterprise architect experience is proving useful to productize new machine
learning applications that have been prototyped by data scientists.
My understanding of alternative architectures leads to well-structured maintainable code,
based on design patterns when appropriate and supported by automated unit tests.

I have delivered:

- AI applications.
- Data pipelines.
- ML models.
- Enterprise application code with unit tests and integration tests.
- Web services.
- Instruction and mentoring in development processes.
- Requirements specifications, including stories, use cases, and UML models.
- Executable Architecture: Framework classes and application infrastructure.
