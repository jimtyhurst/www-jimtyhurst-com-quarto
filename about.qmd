I am an experienced software engineer with a Ph.D. in Linguistics, working in:

- machine learning
- natural language processing.
- data engineering
- statistical analysis

My past enterprise architect experience is proving useful to productize new machine
learning applications that have been prototyped by data scientists.
My understanding of alternative architectures leads to well-structured, maintainable code,
based on design patterns when appropriate and supported by automated unit tests.

I have delivered:

- AI applications.
- Data pipelines.
- ML models.
- Enterprise application code with unit tests.
- Instruction and mentoring in development processes.
- Requirements specifications, including stories, use cases, and UML models.
- Executable Architecture: Framework classes and application infrastructure.
