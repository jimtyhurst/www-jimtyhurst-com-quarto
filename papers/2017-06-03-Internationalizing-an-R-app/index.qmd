## Abstract

As an R developer, I sometimes need to parameterize functions, so that they
can be re-used across different populations. One example is where model
parameters vary across countries. This talk presents a coding idiom for
internationalizing a function, where the output depends on the locale in
which the sampling occurred. This idiom enables code reuse and enhances
testability. I demonstrate the idiom with sample code from scoring an
international student assessment.
