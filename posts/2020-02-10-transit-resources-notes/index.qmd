I worked briefly on a civic tech project for rapid transit and started
reading as much as I could about transit issues.
I use these personal notes to help me remember articles that I have read. I
also hope that they might be a helpful summary and introduction for others.
However, these notes are _not_ intended to be an exhaustive annotated
bibliography nor a complete academic review of the current status of
research. These are just my personal notes of material that I have already
read or references to material that I hope to read soon.

Discusses "the risk of maps that de-center the larger context in favor of the individual. ... When a group of drivers veers off a jammed highway on an app's recommendation, it can thicken congestion for surrounding commuters, even if a few drivers succeed in shaving a few minutes off their individual journeys."

This article is a summary and review of Christof Spieler's book, "[Trains, Buses, People: An Opinionated Atlas of US Transit](#spieler-2018-trains-buses)".  
"Spieler's atlas illustrates how high-performing public transportation boils down to a handful of key tenets: the density and walkability of an area, and the connectivity, frequency, and reliability of the service. Finding the proper capacity to meet demand matters, too, as do speed and legible tools for navigating the system, he writes."

Public transport requirements leading to investment in high-capacity transport:

* Greater access to employment.
* Reduced commuting times.
* Reduced congestion.
* Better control of carbon emissions.

For example, Hong Kong: 79% of residents take public transport to work. Despite a 28% growth in population, commuting times have reduced by 50%. [p. 54]

[Steven Higashide](https://transitcenter.org/team/steven-higashide-2/).<a name="higashide-2019-better-buses" /> 2019. [Better Buses, Better Cities: How to Plan, Run, and Win the Fight for Effective Transit](https://islandpress.org/books/better-buses-better-cities).  
Available at [Multnomah County Libraries](https://multcolib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1385609152).

[p. 10] More people choose buses when they are a useful option for them -- when it's reasonably fast, affordable, and convenient. Decades of research by academics and public agencies show that this is determined mostly by factors such as how often the bus runs, how fast it is compared with alternatives, how reliable it is, and how safe riders feel.

[p. 17] Transit service that is useful to most people satisfies seven basic criteria:

* The service goes where you want to go.
* The service runs frequently enough that you don't have to think about it.
* The service is reasonably fast.
* The service is reliable (you don't have to worry about major delays).
* You can conveniently walk from the service to your final destination.
* The service is comfortable and feels safe.
* The service is affordable.

Subsequent chapters in the book expand on these seven features, describing how they have been achieved in different transit systems.

Chapter 8 "Building a Transit Nation" begins with a reminder that bus riders "often are those who are furthest from the power, held out of policymaking." This chapter describes past funding patterns at the federal and state levels.

Conclusion "Winning Mindsets and Growing Movements"

* [p. 130] "A bus system that doesn't change as its city changes around it is doomed to continually lose ground, like a nest egg that is kept in cash instead of being invested ini a way that gains a return. The good new is that cities can see bus gains in short periods of time. What it takes is alliances of reformers, inside and outside of government."
* Understand transit systems and power structures [p. 131]
* Advocacy groups should have a campaign mindset [p. 135]
* Get representative, strategic public input [p. 136]
    * Get input that is representative of the people who will benefit from better bus service [p. 137]
    * Agency staff need a keen sense of the stakeholders who have the power to champion or derail their project
* Build agencies that can deliver [p. 138]
* Grow a stronger transit reform movement [p. 139]
    * To win better buses in more cities, we need more wonky transit blogs, more faith-based organizing, more riders' unions, and more state budget watchdogs.
    * We need more ways for transit reformers in one city to learn from the triumphs and pitfalls of others.
    * The fastest way to grow the transit reform movement is for local foundations to show sustained interest and energy. [p. 140]
    * Advocates need to be strong enough in the fallow years to build power and develop a clear agenda. That strength allows them to be effective when the moment arrives and also helps them create new opportunities on their own.

Available at [Multnomah County Libraries](https://multcolib.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1400467152).  
This book argues that the secret of 'European-style' public transport lies in a generalizable model of network planning that has worked in places as diverse as rural Switzerland, the Brazilian city of Curitiba and the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver. It shows how this model can be adapted to suburban, exurban and even rural areas to provide a genuine alternative to the car, and outlines the governance, funding and service planning policies that underpin the success of the world's best public transport systems.

    * Serve all trips.
    * Connect centers.
* Walkability
    * Optimize the quarter mile.
    * Create complete networks.
    * Create a great pedestrian environment.
    * Turn front doors to the pedestrian.
* Connectivity
    * Design networks to create connections.
    * Build hubs.
    * Unify fares.
* Frequency
    * Provide all-day frequent service.
* Travel Time
    * Measure access, not distance.
    * Optimize trip time, not speed.
    * Provide express service.
* Reliability
    * Minimize unreliability due to traffic.
    * Minimize unreliability due to boarding.
* Capacity
    * Provide enough capacity to meet demand.
* Legibility
    * Brand the network.
    * Identify lines.
    * Identify frequency.
    * Identify stops.
    * Clarify transfers.
    * Simplify networks.
    * Create a legible experience.

Recorded presentation on 2019-10-08: [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42Fx-2v6KC0) is a 47-minute presentation in Seattle followed by 11 minutes of questions. This presentation added one more dependency for increasing levels of ridership:

* Inclusivity

The book calls out Portland, Oregon for having poor land use with too much single house zoning, which limits the number of people who can use transit.

[p. 24] Seven broad expectations that potential riders have of a transit service that they would consider riding:

1. It takes me _where_ I want to go.
2. It takes me _when_ I want to go.
3. It is a good use of my _time_.
4. It is a good use of my _money_.
5. It _respects_ me in the level of safety, comfort, and amenity it provides.
6. I can _trust_ it.
7. It give me _freedom_ to change my plans.

[p. 26-33] specific things that transit agencies need to provide and measure to meet the seven demands (see Figure 2-1 on p. 27 of the book):

* Stops/Stations: Does it stop near me and my destination?
* Connectivity: Can I get there from here?
* Frequency: What is the maximum waiting time?
* Span: Is it running when I need it?
* Speed or Delay: How much time will we lose along the way?
* Fare: What will it cost?
* Civility: Safety, security, amenity, courtesy, cleanliness, etc.
* Reliability: Doe it run predictably day after day?
* Simplicity: Is the network easy to remember?
* Presentation: Is it easy to learn what I need to know?

[p. 34] 7 phases of a trip:

1. _Understanding_ the service, frequency, and fare.
2. _Accessing (at the origin)_ where you will board the service.
3. _Waiting_ both in terms of time and the quality of the waiting environment.
4. _Paying_ and the form of fare collection.
5. _Riding_ in terms of length of time and quality of time.
6. _Connecting_, which involves repeating steps 1-5.
7. _Accessing (at the destination)_ from the transit stop to your actual destination.

[p. 118] Competing service goals:

* Serve all parts of the community.
* Maximize ridership with a fixed service budget.

## Glossary

[BRT](https://www.itdp.org/library/standards-and-guides/the-bus-rapid-transit-standard/what-is-brt/)<a name="brt-def"></a> : Bus Rapid Transit.

"[headway](https://www.transitwiki.org/TransitWiki/index.php/Headway)"<a name="headway-def"></a> is the amount of time between transit vehicle arrivals at a stop. Headways have a significant impact on how desirable a transit service is, because they effect:

* The time penalty for missing a train or bus
* The amount of planning and preparation needed to use transit and stay on schedule
* The amount of time lost when transit schedules do not directly conform to work, school, or activity schedules
* Average wait times
