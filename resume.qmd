Machine Learning Engineer ([PDF resume](./resources/Jim_Tyhurst-Resume-ML_Engineer.pdf))

I have been an independent consultant since 2000, contracting with companies who need
to write their own software.
I have worked in the roles of machine learning engineer, data engineer, application architect,
R developer, and Enterprise Java developer.

I have used machine learning, rule-based systems, object-oriented design,
functional languages, artificial intelligence techniques, relational databases,
and NoSQL databases.
My understanding of alternative architectures leads to well-structured,
maintainable code based on design patterns when appropriate and supported by
automated unit tests.
